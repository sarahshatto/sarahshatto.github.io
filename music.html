    <p>ROCCKIT! The guitar</a> that generates energy as you play. When you play this guitar, the kinetic energy generated is stored within the base of the guitar and stores that energy that can be transferred to alternate storage. This energy can power lamps, phones, and other sources for power. Let's try and play a song together. Together, we can create a new energy for people that are in need. By providing these instruments for the people of third world countries, we not only provide power to those in need, but emphasize the importance of music in their communities. People need to thrive....stats about music being awesome and helping people.</p>
